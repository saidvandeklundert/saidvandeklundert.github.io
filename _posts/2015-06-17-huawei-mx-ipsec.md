<p>
Today I configured an IPsec VPN between a Huawei AR1220F and a Juniper M104. I wanted to keep the configuration around for future reference.
The configuration on a Huawei is rather straightforward. To put the Huawei AR IPsec configuration in a picture:

Iâ€™ve tried and tested this configuration using the following setup:

Now the configuration to copy-paste from:

Some commands to verify what the AR router is doing (or trying to do):
