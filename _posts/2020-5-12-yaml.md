### Python to YAML serialization

The following dictionary is translated to YAML using `yaml.dump`:

```python
d = {
  'string' : 'string',
  'list': ['item-1', 'item-2',],  
  'nested-dictionary' : { 
    'key-1' : 'value-1',
    'key-2' : 'value-2',
  },
  'True' : True,
  'False' : False,
  'None' : None,
}
```

This produces the following result:

```yaml
string: string
list:
- item-1
- item-2
nested-dictionary:
  key-1: value-1
  key-2: value-2
'True': true
'False': false
None: null
```

To quickly check how a Python data structure converts to YAML, drop to the Python interpreter and perform the following:

<pre style="font-size:12px">
>>> <b>print(yaml.dump(('switch-1', 'switch-2'),sort_keys=False))</b>
!!python/tuple
- switch-1
- switch-2
</pre>



```yaml
paris:
  as: 65000
  syslog: 

spine-2:
leaf-1:
leaf-2:
```



| Python data structures | serializes to YAML |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ |
| dict                   | object             |
| list, tuple            | array              |
| str                    | string             |
| int, float             | number             |
| True                   | true               |
| False                  | false              |
| None                   | null               |



| YAML value         | deserializes to Python |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| object             | dict                   |
| array              | list                   |
| string             | str                    |
| number             | int, float             |
| true               | True                   |
| false              | False                  |
| null               | None                   |




### Emit a Python object as a string of YAML

The <b>dump</b> method is used to serialize a Python object into a YAML stream. In the next example, we emit the Python dictionary as a string:

```python
import yaml

d = {
  'True' : True,
  'False' : False,
  'None' : None,
}

print(yaml.dump(d))
```

The script will output the following:

<pre style="font-size:12px">
'False': false
None: null
'True': true
</pre>

Dump will sort the keys for you. If this is not what you want, use the following to change it:


```python
import yaml

d = {
  'a' : 'a',
  'e' : 'e',      
  'b' : 'b',
  'd' : 'd',
  'c' : 'c',  
}

print(yaml.dump(d, sort_keys=False))
```

This will output the following:

<pre style="font-size:12px">
a: a
e: e
b: b
d: d
c: c
</pre>

### Dump Python object as YAML in a file:

Here, we use the <b>dump</b> method to write a Python object to a file we just opened:

```python
import yaml

d = { 'key' : 'value' }
with open("example.yaml", "w") as fh:  
  (yaml.dump(d, fh))
```

Sometimes, you'll see the dump method used to emit YAML as a string, and write that string to a file like so:

```python
import yaml

d = { 'key' : 'value' }
with open("example.yaml", "w") as fh:  
  fh.write(yaml.dump(d))
```

Both examples result in the following YAML file:

<pre style="font-size:12px">
[root@said ~]$ more example.yaml 
{key: value}
</pre>

### Create a Python object from a YAML string

```python
import yaml

yaml_string = """
France:
  capital: Paris
Italy:
  capital: Rome
list_of_items:
  - item 1
  - item 2
  - item 3  
"""

python_object = yaml.load(yaml_string, Loader=yaml.FullLoader)
print(python_object)
```

This script outputs the following:
<pre style="font-size:12px">
{'France': {'capital': 'Paris'}, 'Italy': {'capital': 'Rome'}, 'list_of_items': ['item 1', 'item 2', 'item 3']}
</pre>


### Create a Python object from a YAML file

```python
import yaml
yaml_file = "example.yaml"
with open(yaml_file, "r") as fh:
  python_object = yaml.load(fh, Loader=yaml.FullLoader)

print(python_object)
```


<pre style="font-size:12px">
__main__:1: YAMLLoadWarning: calling yaml.load() without Loader=... is deprecated, as the default Loader is unsafe. Please read https://msg.pyyaml.org/load for full details.

YAML: YAML Ain't Markup Language

What It Is: YAML is a human friendly data serialization
  standard for all programming languages.


Links:
https://yaml.org/

https://noyaml.com/

Interesting from https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html 1.3. Relation to JSON:


https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml

```
Both JSON and YAML aim to be human readable data interchange formats. However, JSON and YAML have different priorities. JSON’s foremost design goal is simplicity and universality. Thus, JSON is trivial to generate and parse, at the cost of reduced human readability. It also uses a lowest common denominator information model, ensuring any JSON data can be easily processed by every modern programming environment.

In contrast, YAML’s foremost design goals are human readability and support for serializing arbitrary native data structures. Thus, YAML allows for extremely readable files, but is more complex to generate and parse. In addition, YAML ventures beyond the lowest common denominator data types, requiring more complex processing when crossing between different programming environments.

YAML can therefore be viewed as a natural superset of JSON, offering improved human readability and a more complete information model. This is also the case in practice; every JSON file is also a valid YAML file. This makes it easy to migrate from JSON to YAML if/when the additional features are required.
```

Some of YAMLs basic characteristics are the following:
- YAML is case-sensitive
- YAML does not ignore whitespaces
- YAML uses indents for structure
- YAML uses spaces, not tabs
- it is customary to start YAML documents with three dashes '---' (not required)
- Comments start with a '#'
- Strings do not need quotes unless they include special characters
- YAML structures:
  * mappings
  * sequences


YAML mappings.
Mappings are key-value pairs, similar to JSON objects. Example of a mapping:
---
name : Bob
height : 6 foot

YAML sequences.

Sequences are lists or arrays of data, and are similar to JSON arrays. Sequence items start with a dash, example:

---
-apple
-orange
-banana

Sequences do not have to have a name associated with them.
