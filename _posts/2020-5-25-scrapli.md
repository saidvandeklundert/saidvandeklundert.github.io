Recently, I have been looking into a Python library called scrapli. You can use it for screen scraping and what lead me to checking out this package is the fact that it is easy to tap into ssh2-python. This can offer quite some benefits in terms of speed and CPU utilization. This can come in handy when you want to scrape many devices at the same time.  


### Scrapli

Scrapli can be found <a href="https://github.com/carlmontanari/scrapli" target="_blank">here</a>. The <b>README.md</b> is, in my opinion, pretty solid. It has a good decription of what Scrapli is and how you can use it.

The following is an example on how to set up an SSH session and send a command to a device:

```python
from scrapli.driver.core import EOSDriver

my_device = {
    "host": "192.168.1.1",
    "auth_username": "xxx",
    "auth_password": "xxx",
    "auth_strict_key": False,
}

with EOSDriver(**my_device) as conn:
    response = conn.send_command("show version")
    print(response.result)
```

With this example, you can use Scrapli to log in to the device using the SSH binary on your system. You can choose several other transport mechanisms in addition to the default. The other options include paramiko, ssh2-python and telnetlib. 


<a href="https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko" target="_blank">Paramiko</a> is a pure Python interface you can use to control devices. The other transport option that allows you to use SSH is <a href="https://github.com/ParallelSSH/ssh2-python" target="_blank">ssh2-python</a>.

In order to use change the transport to ssh2-python, the <b>tranport</b> needs to be set to <b>ssh2</b>:

```python
from scrapli.driver.core import EOSDriver

my_device = {
    "host": "192.168.1.1",
    "auth_username": "xxx",
    "auth_password": "xxx",
    "auth_strict_key": False,
    "transport" : "ssh2",      
}

with EOSDriver(**my_device) as conn:
    response = conn.send_command("show version")
    print(response.result)
```

If you are normally using Paramiko (or netmiko), you can see things speed up quite a bit. Especially if your script touches many devices. 

### Scrapli in Salt

In SaltStack, whenever SSH is the transport, Netmiko proxy minions use Paramiko to communicate with devices. In some drivers that NAPALM uses, you will also find that Paramiko is used for SSH sessions. If you are managing a lot of devices, these proxy minions can be a bit troublesome in terms of memmory and CPU usage. When you target a large amount of devices, the message bus will allow you to use the proxies to run commands against the devices in near parallel. Switching to a function that uses Scrapli with ssh2 for transport will help you deal with the CPU usage and speed things up at the same time.

Asuming you are using netmiko proxy minions, the following would be a quick way to utilize scrapli:

```python
from scrapli.driver.core import EOSDriver
from scrapli.driver.core import IOSXEDriver
from scrapli.driver.core import NXOSDriver
from scrapli.driver import GenericDriver


__virtualname__ = "scrape"


def cli(command):
    """
    Use scrapli with ssh2 as transport to send a CLI command to a device.

    Args:
        command: string that represents the command you want to send to the device

    Returns:
        string that represents the command output

    CLI example:
        salt router-1 scrape.cli "show version"    

    """
    username = __pillar__["proxy"]["username"]
    password = __pillar__["proxy"]["password"]
    device_type = __pillar__["proxy"]["device_type"]
    host = __pillar__["proxy"]["host"]

    target_device = {
        "host": host,
        "auth_username": username,
        "auth_password": password,
        "auth_strict_key": False,
        "transport" : "ssh2",        
    }

    if 'eos' in device_type:
        with EOSDriver(**target_device) as conn:
            cmd_output = conn.send_command(command).result
        
        return cmd_output
    
    elif 'ios' in device_type:     
        with EOSDriver(**target_device) as conn:
            cmd_output = conn.send_command(command).result
        
        return cmd_output

    elif 'nxos' in device_type:
        with NXOSDriver(**target_device) as conn:
            cmd_output = conn.send_command(command).result
        
        return cmd_output
```

The gain is tremendous. On many devices comparing <b>netmiko.send_command 'show version'</b> can take up to 10 seconds. When I use <b>scrape.cli 'show version'</b>, it takes between 2 and 3 seconds. The best thing though, is the impact on the CPU. Just give it a try on a server and watch the difference in CPU utilization. I was amazed.


### Final thoughts

Using scrapli in Salt can save a lot of CPU. It is not something that will fix the (insane) memmory requirements that come with running a large number of proxies though using Salt. However, Salt is working on a delta proxy. This delta proxy will help drive down the memory usage considerably. Long term, the delta proxy together with scrapli/ssh2-python might be something that will make the management of devices that have no API using Salt a lot better. Short term, scrapli can help with the CPU usage.



The following is are 2 posts where the ssh2-python author compares paramiko with his own package:
<a href="https://parallel-ssh.org/post/ssh2-python/" target="_blank">The State of Python SSH Libraries</a><br>
<a href="https://parallel-ssh.org/post/parallel-ssh-libssh2/" target="_blank">parallel-ssh Clients</a><br>


Ps, another short term solution to the memory issue and burden that comes with managing many proxies would be looking into <a href="https://github.com/mirceaulinic/salt-sproxy" target="_blank">salt-sproxy</a>. Things will not happen in near parallel as you do not use the message bus, but the upside is that you have no more proxy minions to manage.
