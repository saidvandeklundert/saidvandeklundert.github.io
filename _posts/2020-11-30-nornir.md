In the search for a framework that would allow me to plug my automations without too much fuss, I came accross <b>Nornir</b>. I have been enjoying it so much that I decided to do write down an introduction for others. My hope is that this post will allow others to hit the ground running.

# Nornir

The 'about' section in the Nornir repo does a good job summarizing it. Stated is that Nornir is a 'pluggable multi-threaded framework with inventory management to help operate collections of devices'.

In Nornir, you write <b>tasks</b> that perform an automation for a single device. Nornir can run these tasks against devices defined in its inventory. You can run a task against all hosts or you can choose to target hosts based on characteristics defined in the inventory. After Nornir is done running the tasks, it returns the results in a Python object. You can output the results on screen or write something to store them in a database.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![Nornir parts](/img/nornir_parts.png "Nornir parts")
{: refdef}

Something really worth noting is the Nornir's speed and efficiency. Without having to put in a lot of effort yourself, you can send a command to 5.000 devices in 3 minutes using minimal resources.

Nornir does not come with a DSL. You express yourself in Python. All the tasks you create, all the flow control you put into your automation and all the debugging is done in Python. In my opinion, this is a lot cleaner and better when compared to what most DSLs have to offer. 

Working with Nornir implies that you can use everything that is available in the Python ecosystem. Most people using other frameworks tout the fact that it comes with 'batteries included'. Most often, these 'batteries' are the hard work of others. They are Python modules and libraries, brought to you by the open source community. Quite often, you can pip install the same libraries and plug them into Nornir.

Another thing worth mentioning about is the fact that Nornir is so <b>minimal</b> and to the point. In Nornir, there are very little constructs you have to worry about or familiarize yourself with. As soon as you understand the basic mechanics, you are good to go. 


# Installing Nornir and setting up the inventory

The best way to better understand Nornir is to create and run a few tasks yourself. First, let's install Nornir and the plugins used in this article:

```
pip3 install nornir
pip3 install nornir_napalm
pip3 install nornir_netmiko
pip3 install nornir_utils
```

At the time of writing, this installed nornir 3.0.0. All the plugins I used were version 0.1.1.

Before we can run any task in Nornir, we need to have an inventory. The inventory is where the characteristics of devices Nornir needs to touch are defined. Nornir allows you to interface with external systems and use that data to programmatically build an inventory. It also ships with a <b>SimpleInventory</b>, which is what we'll use in this example. Using the SimpleInventory, we need to define three YAML files for the following:
- hosts
- groups
- defaults


The hosts define the devices that Nornir can target. We can define elaborate characteristics for every host, but in this example, we will stick to the basics. The following is the hosts file I will be using, stored under `/inventory/hosts.yaml`:

```yaml
veos01:
  hostname: 10.254.169.50
  groups:
    - arista
veos02:
  hostname: 10.254.169.51
  groups:
    - arista
```

We defined 2 hosts: <b>veos01</b> and <b>veos02</b>. We specified an IP address and we put the devices in a group. Inside the groups, we can define attributes that hosts will inherit.

The following is the groups file that will put in place the defaults that will allow you to manage devices using the NAPALM plugin. The file is stored as `/inventory/groups.yaml`:
                   
```yaml
juniper: { platform: junos, port: 830 }
arista: { platform: eos, port: 22 }
arista_eapi: { platform: eos, port: 443}
cisco_ios: { platform: ios, port: 22 }
cisco_nxos: { platform: nxos, port: 22 }
```

We assigned the hosts to the <b>arista_eapi</b> group. This means that the hosts will be of the platform 'eos' and they will use port '443'. 

Lastly, our example also requires a <b>defaults</b>, which we will store as `/inventory/defaults.yaml`:

```yaml
username: admin
password: password
```

The characteristics defined in the defaults are added to every device. Host or groups characteristics take precedence. So in case you want to make a <b>juniper</b> device use a different password, you could overwrite the default password at the group level.

The groups and defaults can be used for more than just instructions on how to connect to devices. They are a nice construct to use to describe your infrastructure on a more abstract level and have that data available at runtime inside a task when you execute the script. You could create groups for datacenters and assign every datacenter with an AS, a syslog IP, management subnets etc. Doing so allows you to use that information for a variety of reasons. Two important things you could use this information for are targeting and templating.


# Running your first task

A good first Nornir script could be one where you do nothing more then send the <b>show version</b> command to the devices in the inventory and return the output to your screen. The following example will do just that:

```python
"""
Nornir example script sending a command using netmiko
"""
from nornir import InitNornir
from nornir_utils.plugins.functions import print_result
from nornir.plugins.inventory.simple import SimpleInventory
from nornir.core.plugins.inventory import InventoryPluginRegister
from nornir_netmiko.tasks import netmiko_send_command

if __name__ == "__main__":    
    InventoryPluginRegister.register("SimpleInventory", SimpleInventory)
    
    nr = InitNornir(
        runner={
            "plugin": "threaded",
            "options": {
                "num_workers": 30,
            },
        },
        inventory={
            "plugin": "SimpleInventory",
            "options": {
                    "host_file": "/inventory/hosts.yaml",
                    "group_file": "/inventory/groups.yaml",
                    "defaults_file": "/inventory/defaults.yaml"
            },
        }
    )      

    result = nr.run(netmiko_send_command, command_string="show version")

    print_result(result)
```

We started off importing all the required libraries. After this, we instruct Nornir to use the SimpleInventory plugin and we create a Nornir object referencing the files that contain the hosts, groups and defaults.

After the `nr` object is created, we run the <b>netmiko_send_command</b> task against every host and issue the <b>show version command</b>. When the task is completed, we use <b>print_result</b> to output the return of the task to screen. After running the script, we can see the following:

```

 A task is a function that is executed against the devices targeted by Nornir. In our example, the main task that will be executed for every device that is targeted. The main task will execute 7 subtasks. 

# Working with main tasks


Sending a command to all the devices in the inventory is nice for starters. But how can we create something more involved? And what is actually going on here?

In this section, I am breaking down the example script found [here](https://github.com/saidvandeklundert/nornir/blob/main/nornir_example.py).

This script will start of initializing Nornir and loading the inventory. After this, the script will execute the task called <b>main_task</b> against every device in the inventory. The main task will execute 7 subtasks:

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![Nornir tasks](/img/nornir_tasks.png "Nornir tasks")
{: refdef}

Organizing tasks in this way let's you create and manage bigger programms. Note that this is not the way you HAVE to do things in Nornir, it is just a way in which you COULD choose to do things in Nornir.

The first 4 subtasks should help you understand how Nornir does something. The subtasks log something, take arguments and inspect the task and the result objects.

The last three subtasks illustrate how to perform various operations using the NAPALM plugin. We will send a command, use a NAPALM getter and finish up configuring a device.

Since we are now using NAPALM instead of Netmiko, we also need to change the host file we are using. Netmiko uses SSH to connect to devices. When NAPALM is used to communicate with an Arista, the eapi is used. For this reason, we change the group the hosts are placed in from <b>arista</b> to <b>arista_eapi</b>:

```yaml
veos01:
  hostname: 10.254.169.50
  groups:
    - arista_eapi
veos02:
  hostname: 10.254.169.51
  groups:
    - arista_eapi
```


## Initializing Nornir

The following function can be used to initialize the Nornir object:

```python
def get_nornir_cfg():
    """
    Returns the Nornir object.
    """
    InventoryPluginRegister.register("SimpleInventory", SimpleInventory)
    nr = InitNornir(
        runner={
            "plugin": "threaded",
            "options": {
                "num_workers": 100,
            },
        },
        inventory={
            "plugin": "SimpleInventory",
            "options": {
                    "host_file": "/inventory/hosts.yaml",
                    "group_file": "/inventory/groups.yaml",
                    "defaults_file": "/inventory/defaults.yaml"
            },
        }
    )
    return nr
```

The object that is returned can be used to run a task against the hosts defined in the inventory. The task will be threaded using 100 workers.

The following shows how we can first construct the <b>nr</b> object and then run a task called <b>main_task</b> against all the devices. We finish up printing the result of the task using <b>print_result</b>

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":

    
    nr = get_nornir_cfg()

    result = nr.run(
        name="Task example and explanation function.",
        task=main_task,
        example_arg_1="arg_1",
        example_arg_2="arg_2",
        template_string=template_string,
        dry_run=True
    )

    print_result(result)
```


## Tasks and subtasks

The previous code runs the <b>main_task</b> against all the hosts in the inventory. In the example script, the main task is defined as follows:

```python
def main_task(task: Task, example_arg_1, example_arg_2, template_string, dry_run=True) -> Result:
    """
    This is the main task or function of the program. 
    
    We will call several sub tasks from this task.
    """
    
    task.run(
        name="Logging example.",
        task=log_something,
    )
    
    task.run(
        name="example_task",
        task=example_task,
        example_arg_1=example_arg_1,
        example_arg_2=example_arg_2,
    )
    
    result_to_examine = task.run(
        name="examine task",
        task=examine_task,
    )

    task.run(
        name="examine result",
        task=examine_result,
        result = result_to_examine        
    )    
    
    task.run(
        name="example command using NAPALM",
        task=example_command_using_napalm,
    )
    
    task.run(
        name="example using NAPALM getters",
        task=example_napalm_getters,
    )

    task.run(
        name="example configuration using NAPALM",
        task=example_napalm_configure,        
        template_string=template_string,        
        dry_run=dry_run,
    )

    return Result(
        host=task.host,
        result="Example task finished!",
    )
```

The main task shown here groups the subtasks together and will run them one after the other.


### Illustration tasks

The first subtask that is called in the main task will log a message:

```python
logger = logging.getLogger('nornir')


def log_something(task: Task,) -> Result:
    """
    Nornir will log to 'nornir.log' by default.
    """    
    logger.info(f"{task.host.name} says hi!")
    logger.warning("Warning %r is running task %r", task.host.name, task.name)    
    return Result(
        host=task.host,
        result=f"Task {task.name} made some log updates"
    )
```

The first line grabs the default logger used in Nornir. You can use this to output messages to the <b>nornir.log</b> file that is used by default. Next is the function that defines the subtask. The function logs 2 messages and then returns a result. When we run the example script, we will see the following appear on screen for every host:

```
---- Logging example. ** changed : False --------------------------------------- INFO
Task Logging example. made some log updates
```

When we inspect the <b>nornir.log</b>, we can see veos01 logged the following:

```
2020-11-28 20:10:03,769 -       nornir -     INFO - log_something() - veos01 sayd hi
2020-11-28 20:10:03,770 -       nornir -  WARNING - log_something() - Warning 'veos01' is running task 'Logging example.'
```

The following subtasks run after the logging task:
- illustrate passing additional arguments to a subtask
- inspect the task object
- inspect the result object


```python
def example_task(task: Task, example_arg_1, example_arg_2) -> Result:
    """
    This is an example sub-task that can be used in a Nornir main task.

    Purpose of this task it to return the example arguments.
    """
    task_result = f"Got the following:\nexample_arg_1: {example_arg_1}\nexample_arg_2: {example_arg_2}"
    return Result(
        host=task.host,
        result=task_result
    )


def examine_task(task: Task,) -> Result:
    """
    This task will return information that describes the task object.
    """
    ret_dict ={
        "task" : task,
        "task name" : task.name,
        "host dict" : task.host.dict(),
        "groups content" : task.host.groups[0].dict(),
        "default content" : task.host.defaults.dict(),
        "task methods" : dir(task),
        "host methods" : dir(task.host),
        "task type" : type(task),        
    }
    # to have a detailed look around, consider setting a trace by removing next line's comment:
    #import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
    return Result(
        host=task.host,
        result=ret_dict
    )


def examine_result(task: Task, result) -> Result:
    """
    This task will return information describing the result object.
    """
    ret_dict ={
        "result" : result,
        "result methods" : dir(result),
        "task type" : type(result),        
    }
    # to have a detailed look around, consider setting a trace by removing next line's comment:
    #import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
    return Result(
        host=task.host,
        result=ret_dict
    )
```


Since the output for these tasks is quite lengthy, I pasted the output [here](https://github.com/saidvandeklundert/nornir/blob/main/example_output.txt). A thing to point out in this last function is the way in which you can troubleshoot scripts that use Nornir. You can insert <b>import pdb; pdb.set_trace()</b> at any point in the code and have a look around to see what is happening.


### NAPALM tasks

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![NAPALM logo](/img/napalm_logo.png "NAPALM logo")
{: refdef}

There are plugins available to Nornir that come with tasks that allow you to interface with a library that is not part of the Nornir core repo. This example script uses the several of the NAPALM tasks that `nornir_napalm` provides. The Nornir NAPALM repo can be found [here](https://github.com/nornir-automation/nornir_napalm).

As mentioned earlier, plugins are installed separately. To install the NAPALM plugin, we do the following:

```
pip install nornir_napalm
```

After this, you will be able to import the tasks into your scripts:

```python
from nornir_napalm.plugins.tasks import napalm_configure, napalm_cli, napalm_get
```

The example script has three subtask that use the NAPALM plugin. The first subtask that uses the plugin is calling <b>napalm_cli</b> to send a few commands to a device:

```python
def example_command_using_napalm(task: Task,) -> Result:
    """
    Send commands using napalm_cli
    """
    cmd_ret = task.run(
        task=napalm_cli, commands=[
            'show version',
            'show hostname',
            ],
    )
    # In case you want to work with the returns for the individual commands, uncomment the following lines:
    #show_version_output = cmd_ret[0].result['show version']
    #config = cmd_ret[0].result['show hostname']

    return Result(
        host=task.host,
        result=cmd_ret
    )
```

The previous subtask will return the output of the commands:

```
vvvv example command using NAPALM ** changed : False vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv INFO
MultiResult: [Result: "napalm_cli"]
---- napalm_cli ** changed : False --------------------------------------------- INFO

                  '\n'
                  'Software image version: 4.24.1.1F\n'
                  'Architecture:           i686\n'

                  'Internal build ID:      '
                  'cf3ba327-e192-46b4-8e8e-4aeaee798dd2\n'
                  '\n'
                  'Uptime:                 12 weeks, 4 days, 16 hours and 41 '
                  'minutes\n'
                  'Total memory:           1872580 kB\n'
                  'Free memory:            1072492 kB\n'
                  '\n'}
^^^^ END example command using NAPALM ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

The main task then continues to run a subtask that let's you access the NAPALM getters:

```python
def example_napalm_getters(task: Task,) -> Result:
    """
    Example on how to use the NAPALM getters.

    There are a lot more getters, find them here:
        https://napalm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/support/
    """
    napalm_getters = task.run(
        task = napalm_get, getters=["get_facts"],
        )
    
    return Result(
        host=task.host,
        result=napalm_getters
    )
```

The getters you are interested are put in a list and then passed to the `napalm_get` task. In this example, we are retrieving the facts:

```
vvvv example using NAPALM getters ** changed : False vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv INFO
MultiResult: [Result: "napalm_get"]
---- napalm_get ** changed : False --------------------------------------------- INFO

                                     'Loopback0',
                                     'Management1',
                                     'Port-Channel1000',
                                     'Vlan4094'],

                 'vendor': 'Arista'}}
^^^^ END example using NAPALM getters ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

The final example details how you can use the `napalm_configure` plugin:

```python
template_string = """
interface loopback 0
description Nornir
"""

def example_napalm_configure(task: Task, template_string, dry_run=True) -> Result:
    """
    Example on how to use the NAPALM to configure devices.
        
    If dry_run is set to True, this task will only retrieve a diff.
    """
    
    napalm_ret = task.run(
        task=napalm_configure,
        dry_run=dry_run,
        configuration=template_string,
    )
    return Result(
        host=task.host,
        result=napalm_ret
    )
```

The task was passed a string in the main task. And because we set dry_run to `True`, we are not committing the configuration. We enter configure sessions, obtain a diff and perform a rollback. The task result will tell us whether or not applying the configuration will result in a change and what the actual change would look like. In case there is a diff, it is shown as follows:

```
vvvv example configuration using NAPALM ** changed : False vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv INFO

```

The + or - characaters indicated what lines will be added/removed from the configuration.


# Working with the result

Initially, the result left me a bit puzzled. I did not really understand the `AggregatedResult` and `MultiResult` you end up with after `nr.run`:

```python
    result = nr.run(
        name="Task example and explanation function.",
        task=main_task,
        example_arg_1="arg_1",
        example_arg_2="arg_2",
        template_string=template_string,
        dry_run=True
    )
```

To better understand the <b>result</b>, I ran the script with `python -i`. This will enter interactive mode after executing the script. As we can see, the <b>result</b> is a dict-like object that shows us the results of all the hosts we ran the task against:

```python
>>> result
AggregatedResult (Task example and explanation function.): {'veos01': MultiResult: [Result: "Task example and explanation function.", Result: "Logging example.", Result: "example_task", Result: "examine task", Result: "examin result", MultiResult: [Result: "example command using NAPALM", Result: "napalm_cli"], MultiResult: [Result: "example using NAPALM getters", Result: "napalm_get"], MultiResult: [Result: "example configuration using NAPALM", Result: "napalm_configure"]], 'veos02': MultiResult: [Result: "Task example and explanation function.", Result: "Logging example.", Result: "example_task", Result: "examine task", Result: "examin result", MultiResult: [Result: "example command using NAPALM", Result: "napalm_cli"], MultiResult: [Result: "example using NAPALM getters", Result: "napalm_get"], MultiResult: [Result: "example configuration using NAPALM", Result: "napalm_configure"]]}
>>> 
```

Inside the <b>AggregatedResult</b>, we can find the results for all the individual hosts. To check what hosts we have a result for, we can look at the keys of the result:

```python
>>> result.keys()
dict_keys(['veos01', 'veos02'])
>>>
```

Supplying the hostname as key will lead to the result of an individual host. The result for an individual host is called <b>Multiresult</b>. This multiresult contains a list of the results for every subtask that was executed for the host.

```python
>>> type(result['veos01'])
nornir.core.task.MultiResult
>>> result['veos01']      
MultiResult: [Result: "Task example and explanation function.", Result: "Logging example.", Result: "example_task", Result: "examine task", Result: "examin result", MultiResult: [Result: "example command using NAPALM", Result: "napalm_cli"], MultiResult: [Result: "example using NAPALM getters", Result: "napalm_get"], MultiResult: [Result: "example configuration using NAPALM", Result: "napalm_configure"]]
>>>
```

We can access the result of a subtask by entering the index number. In the following example, we access the logging subtask and the NAPALM configure subtask:

```python
>>> result['veos01'][1]
Result: "Logging example."
>>> result['veos01'][7]
MultiResult: [Result: "example configuration using NAPALM", Result: "napalm_configure"]
>>> 
```

For the logging task, we can see a result. For the configuration task, we can see a (nested) Multiresult. 

With individual tasks, we can retrieve the parameters associated with the result of a task like this:

```python
>>> result['veos01'][1].result
'Task Logging example. some log updates'
>>> result['veos01'][1].failed
False
```
Accessing the nested Multiresult for the confiuration task would be done using <b>result['veos02'][7].result[0].diff</b>.

The task documentation should reflect what you can expect a task to return. In the above example, we could see the string that was returned in our example task. When we check the NAPALM plugin documentation for the configure function, we can see that it returns the following:

```
    Returns:
        Result object with the following attributes set:
          * changed (``bool``): whether the task is changing the system or not
          * diff (``string``): change in the system
```

This means that we should be able to retrieve these two values:

```python
>>> result['veos01'][7].result[0].diff  
'@@ -41,6 +41,7 @@\n    channel-group 1000 mode active\n !\n interface Loopback0\n+   description Nornir\n    ip address 5.5.5.5/32\n !\n interface Management1'
>>> 
>>> result['veos01'][7].result[0].changed
True
```

The description for the return for the NAPALM plugin was found [here](https://github.com/nornir-automation/nornir_napalm/blob/master/nornir_napalm/plugins/tasks/napalm_configure.py). 


Last thing to point out is that, using the Aggregrated result, you can quickly see what hosts failed at a task:

```python
>>> result.failed_hosts
{}
>>> 
```

Any failed hosts will show up in that dictionary. To see if any host failed at a task, you can also use the following:

```
>>> result['veos01'].failed
False
>>> 
```

# Final thoughts

Developing automations with Nornir is a lot of fun. What I like about it is the fact that it is so minimal and that you can things in the way you want to. 

It takes care of the inventory and let's you run tasks against devices, but it does not impose. It is lightweight and fast, but does not ask for much in terms of memory or CPU.

If you like working on network automation using Python, Nornir is definitely something to consider.

I was looking for something lightweight that would just 'get the job done'. After playing and working with Nornir for a little while, I think I found it.
