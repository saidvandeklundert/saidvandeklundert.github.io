Over the last few weeks or so, I have been working with Nornir. Nornir is described as a 'Pluggable multi-threaded framework with inventory management to help operate collections of devices'. I looked into it hoping to find something lightweight that would just get the job done and I found just that.

# Nornir

Nornir let's you run tasks against a collection of devices. It allows you to run tasks against devices that can be organized in it's inventory. 

Not only is Nornir written in Python, everything in Nornir is done in Python. This means there is no DSL to work with. Everything you do is expressed in Python. This means that you can work with everything that is available in the Python ecosystem. Not only can you make use of all the usual suspects, you are not bound or limited in any way from using whatever other packages you are fond of. In the past, I had extended the PyEZ device class with several methods that I re-use over and over again. Plugging that into Norir was effortless. 

Additionally, all flow control and debugging is done in Python. This is, in my opinion, a lot cleaner and better when compared to what most DSLs have to offer. 

The thing I really like about Nornir is the fact that it is so <b>minimal</b> and to the point. There are very little constructs you have to worry about making , if you understand the basic mechanics, you are good to go. 


# Nornir: getting started

The best way to better understand Nornir is to make and run a few tasks yourself. In this example, we'll use the <b>SimpleInventory</b> where we can define the inventory. There are three parts to the inventory:
- hosts
- groups
- defaults


The hosts define the devices that we can target with Nornir. We can define elaborate characteristics for every host, but in this example, we will stick to the basics:

```yaml
veos01:
  hostname: 10.254.169.50
  groups:
    - arista_eapi
veos02:
  hostname: 10.254.169.51
  groups:
    - arista_eapi
```

We defined 2 hosts: veos01 and veos02. We specified an IP address and we sinified group membership. Inside the groups, we can define attributes and by assigning hosts to a group, the hosts will inherit these attribtes.

The following is a groups file that will put in pace the defaults that will allow you to manage devices using the NAPALM plugin:

```yaml
juniper: { platform: junos, port: 830 }
arista: { platform: eos, port: 22 }
arista_eapi: { platform: eos, port: 443}
cisco_ios: { platform: ios, port: 22 }
cisco_nxos: { platform: nxos, port: 22 }
```

We assigned the hosts to the <b>arista_eapi</b> group. This means that the hosts will be of the platform 'eos' and they will use port '443'. 

Lastly, our example also requires a <b>defaults</b>:

```yaml
username: admin
password: password
```

The characteristics defined in the defaults are added to every device. Host or groups characteristics take precedence. So in case you want to have <b>juniper</b>> group use a different password, you could overwrite the default password at the group level.

The groups and defaults can be used for more than just instructions on how to connect to devices. They are a nice construct to use to describe your infrastructure on a more abstract level and have that data available at runtime inside a task when you execute the script. You could create groups for datacenters and assign every datacenter with an AS, a syslog IP, management subnets etc. Doing so allows you to use that information for a variety of reasons. The two most important ones (I think) are targeting and templating.

# Example script

In this section, I am breaking down the example script found [here](https://github.ibm.com/neteng/prelude#templating).


## Initializing Nornir

```python
def get_nornir_cfg():
    """
    Returns the Nornir object.
    """
    InventoryPluginRegister.register("SimpleInventory", SimpleInventory)
    nr = InitNornir(
        runner={
            "plugin": "threaded",
            "options": {
                "num_workers": 100,
            },
        },
        inventory={
            "plugin": "SimpleInventory",
            "options": {
                    "host_file": "/inventory/hosts_eos_virt.yaml",
                    "group_file": "/inventory/groups.yaml",
                    "defaults_file": "/inventory/defaults_virt.yaml"
            },
        }
    )
    return nr

```

The above function will return a Nornir object. This object can be used to run a task against the hosts defined in the inventory. The task will be threaded using 100 workers.

The following shows how we can first construct the <b>nr</b> object and then run a task called <b>main_task</b> against all the devices. We finish up printing the result of the task using <b>print_result</b>

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":


    nr = get_nornir_cfg()
    # target specific devices
    nr =  nr.filter(F(groups__contains="arista_eapi")

    result = nr.run(
        name="Task example and explanation function.",
        task=main_task,
        example_arg_1="arg_1",
        example_arg_2="arg_2",
    )

    print_result(result)
```

## Tasks and subtasks

The previous code runs the <b>main_task</b> against all the hosts in the inventory that are a member of the <b>arista_eapi</b> group. 

Now on to defining the task.

```python
def main_task(task: Task, example_arg_1, example_arg_2) -> Result:
    """
    This is the main task or function of the program. 
    
    We will call several sub tasks from this task.
    """
    
    task.run(
        name="Logging example.",
        task=log_something,
    )
    
    task.run(
        name="example_task",
        task=example_task,
        example_arg_1=example_arg_1,
        example_arg_2=example_arg_2,
    )
    
    result_to_examine = task.run(
        name="examine task",
        task=examine_task,
    )

    task.run(
        name="examine result",
        task=examine_result,
        result = result_to_examine        
    )    
    
    task.run(
        name="example command using NAPALM",
        task=example_command_using_napalm,
    )

    task.run(
        name="example using NAPALM getters",
        task=example_napalm_getters,
    )

    task.run(
        name="example configuration using NAPALM",
        task=example_napalm_configure,
    )   
    
    return Result(
        host=task.host,
        result="Example task finished!",
    )
```

The main task shown here will run the defined sub-tasks against the hosts that are targeted by the script. The first 4 subtasks aim to illustrate how Nornir works. The tasks after that give a few examples on how to perform basic operations using Nornir.

### Nornir illustration functions

The first subtask defined in the main task is an example on how to log something:

```python
logger = logging.getLogger('nornir')


def log_something(task: Task,) -> Result:
    """
    Nornir will log to 'nornir.log' by default.
    """    
    logger.info(f"{task.host.name} says hi!")
    logger.warning("Warning %r is running task %r", task.host.name, task.name)    
    return Result(
        host=task.host,
        result=f"Task {task.name} made some log updates"
    )
```

The first line is outside the function, and it grabs the default logger used in Nornir. You can use this to output messages to the <b>nornir.log</b> file that is used by default.

After this, the function that defines the subtask starts. The function logs 2 messages and then returns a result. When we run the example script, we will see the following appear on screen for every host:

```
---- Logging example. ** changed : False --------------------------------------- INFO
Task Logging example. made some log updates
```

Example of what is logged to <b>nornir.log</b> for veos01:

```
2020-11-28 20:10:03,769 -       nornir -     INFO - log_something() - veos01 sayd hi
2020-11-28 20:10:03,770 -       nornir -  WARNING - log_something() - Warning 'veos01' is running task 'Logging example.'
```

The functions run after the logging functions illustrute how to pass additional arguments, inspect the task object and inspect the result object:

```python
def example_task(task: Task, example_arg_1, example_arg_2) -> Result:
    """
    This is an example sub-task that can be used in a Nornir main task.

    Purpose of this task it to return the example arguments.
    """
    task_result = f"Got the following:\nexample_arg_1: {example_arg_1}\nexample_arg_2: {example_arg_2}"
    return Result(
        host=task.host,
        result=task_result
    )


def examine_task(task: Task,) -> Result:
    """
    This task will return information that describes the task object.
    """
    ret_dict ={
        "task" : task,
        "task name" : task.name,
        "host dict" : task.host.dict(),
        "groups content" : task.host.groups[0].dict(),
        "default content" : task.host.defaults.dict(),
        "task methods" : dir(task),
        "host methods" : dir(task.host),
        "task type" : type(task),        
    }
    # to have a detailed look around, consider setting a trace by removing next line's comment:
    #import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
    return Result(
        host=task.host,
        result=ret_dict
    )


def examine_result(task: Task, result) -> Result:
    """
    This task will return information describing the result object.
    """
    ret_dict ={
        "result" : result,
        "result methods" : dir(result),
        "task type" : type(result),        
    }
    # to have a detailed look around, consider setting a trace by removing next line's comment:
    #import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
    return Result(
        host=task.host,
        result=ret_dict
    )
```

A think to point out in this last function is the way in which you can troubleshoot scripts that use Nornir. You can insert <b>import pdb; pdb.set_trace()</b> at any point in the code and have a look around to see what is happening.


### Nornir basic device handling


There are plugins available to Nornir that come with tasks that allow you to interface with a library that is not part of the Nornir core repo. The example script uses the several of the NAPALM tasks that `nornir_napalm` provides. 

More on Nornir NAPALM can be found [here](https://github.com/nornir-automation/nornir_napalm).

Plugins are installed separately, so in case you want to use the napalm plugin, you will have to install it first:

```
pip install nornir_napalm
```

After having installed the pluging, you can import the tasks into your scripts like so:
```python
from nornir_napalm.plugins.tasks import napalm_configure, napalm_cli, napalm_get
```

The example script contains several operations that are needed often when managing network devices.

```python
def example_command_using_napalm(task: Task,) -> Result:
    """
    Send commands using napalm_cli
    """
    cmd_ret = task.run(
        task=napalm_cli, commands=[
            'show version',
            'show hostname',
            ],
    )
    # In case you want to work with the returns for the individual commands, uncomment the following lines:
    #show_version_output = cmd_ret[0].result['show version']
    #config = cmd_ret[0].result['show hostname']

    return Result(
        host=task.host,
        result=cmd_ret
    )
```

This section will output the return of the command:

```

                  'Free memory:            1072492 kB\n'
                  '\n'}
^^^^ END example command using NAPALM ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```


The following is an example on how you can access the NAPALM getters:

```python
def example_napalm_getters(task: Task,) -> Result:
    """
    Example on how to use the NAPALM getters.

    There are a lot more getters, find them here:
        https://napalm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/support/
    """
    napalm_getters = task.run(
        task = napalm_get, getters=["get_facts"],
        )
    
    return Result(
        host=task.host,
        result=napalm_getters
    )
```


The getters you are interested are put in a list and then passed to the `napalm_get` task. In this example, we are retrieving the facts:

```
vvvv example using NAPALM getters ** changed : False vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv INFO
MultiResult: [Result: "napalm_get"]
---- napalm_get ** changed : False --------------------------------------------- INFO

                 'interface_list': [ 'Ethernet1',
                                     'Loopback0',
                                     'Management1',
                                     'Port-Channel1000',
                                     'Vlan4094'],
                 'model': 'vEOS',
                 'os_version': '4.24.1.1F-17172302.42411F',
                 'serial_number': '',
                 'uptime': 7660573,
                 'vendor': 'Arista'}}
^^^^ END example using NAPALM getters ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

The final example details how you can use the `napalm_configure` plugin:

```python
def example_napalm_configure(task: Task,) -> Result:
    """
    Example on how to use the NAPALM to configure devices.
        
    Since dry_run is set to True, this task will only retrieve a diff.

    In this example, Arista EOS is used.
    """
    template_string = """interface loopback 0\ndescription Nornir"""
    napalm_ret = task.run(
        task=napalm_configure,
        configuration=template_string,
        dry_run=True
    )
    return Result(
        host=task.host,
        result=napalm_ret
    )
```

The task was passed a string in the main task. And because we set dry_run to `True`, we are not committing the configuration. We enter configure sessions, obtain a diff and perform a rollback. The task result will tell us whether or not applying the configuration will result in a change and what the actual change would look like:
These functions

```

```


# Working with the result

Initially, the result left me a bit puzzled. I did not really understand the `AggregatedResult` and `MultiResult` you end up with after `nr.run`:

```python
result = nr.run(
        name="Task example and explanation function.",
        task=main_task,
        example_arg_1="arg_1",
        example_arg_2="arg_2",
    )
```

To better understand the <b>result</b>, I ran the script with `python -i`. This will to enter interactive mode after executing the script. As we can see, the <b>result</b> is a dict-like object that shows us the results of all the hosts we ran the task against:

```python
>>> result
AggregatedResult (Task example and explanation function.): {'veos01': MultiResult: [Result: "Task example and explanation function.", Result: "Logging example.", Result: "example_task", Result: "examine task", Result: "examin result", MultiResult: [Result: "example command using NAPALM", Result: "napalm_cli"], MultiResult: [Result: "example using NAPALM getters", Result: "napalm_get"], MultiResult: [Result: "example configuration using NAPALM", Result: "napalm_configure"]], 'veos02': MultiResult: [Result: "Task example and explanation function.", Result: "Logging example.", Result: "example_task", Result: "examine task", Result: "examin result", MultiResult: [Result: "example command using NAPALM", Result: "napalm_cli"], MultiResult: [Result: "example using NAPALM getters", Result: "napalm_get"], MultiResult: [Result: "example configuration using NAPALM", Result: "napalm_configure"]]}
>>> 
```

Inside the aggregated result, we can find the results for all the individual hosts. To check what hosts we have a result for, we can look at the keys of the result:

```python
>>> result.keys()
dict_keys(['veos01', 'veos02'])
>>>
```

Supplying the hostname as key will lead to the result of an individual host. The result for an individual host is called <b>Multiresult</b>. This multiresult contains a list of the results for every subtask that was executed for the host.

```python
>>> type(result['veos01'])
nornir.core.task.MultiResult
>>> result['veos01']      
MultiResult: [Result: "Task example and explanation function.", Result: "Logging example.", Result: "example_task", Result: "examine task", Result: "examin result", MultiResult: [Result: "example command using NAPALM", Result: "napalm_cli"], MultiResult: [Result: "example using NAPALM getters", Result: "napalm_get"], MultiResult: [Result: "example configuration using NAPALM", Result: "napalm_configure"]]
>>>
```

We can access the result of a subtask by entering the index number:

```python
>>> result['veos01'][1]
Result: "Logging example."
>>> result['veos01'][7]
MultiResult: [Result: "example configuration using NAPALM", Result: "napalm_configure"]
>>> 
```

TIf we access an individual task, we can retrieve the parameters associated with the result of a task:

```python
>>> result['veos01'][1].result
'Task Logging example. some log updates'
>>> result['veos01'][1].failed
False
```

The task documentation should reflect what you can expext a task to return. In the above example, we could see the string that was returned in our example task. When we check the NAPALM plugin documentation for the configure function, we can see that it returns the following:

```
    Returns:
        Result object with the following attributes set:
          * changed (``bool``): whether the task is changing the system or not
          * diff (``string``): change in the system
```

This means that we should be able to retrieve these two values:

```python
>>> result['veos01'][7].result[0].diff  
'@@ -41,6 +41,7 @@\n    channel-group 1000 mode active\n !\n interface Loopback0\n+   description Nornir\n    ip address 5.5.5.5/32\n !\n interface Management1'
>>> 
>>> result['veos01'][7].result[0].changed
True
```

The description for the return for the NAPALM plugin was found [here](https://github.com/nornir-automation/nornir_napalm/blob/master/nornir_napalm/plugins/tasks/napalm_configure.py). 


Last thing to point out is that, using the Aggregrated result, you can quickly see what hosts failed at a task:

```python
>>> result.failed_hosts
{}
>>> 
```
Any failed hosts will show up in that dictionary. To see if any host failed at a task, you can also use the following:
```
>>> result['dar01_ims'].failed
False
>>> 
```


# Final thoughts

Developing automations with Nornir is really great. The main things I like about it is how minimal it is and the fact that Nornir let's you do the thing you want to do in the way you want to. 

It takes care of the inventory and let's you run tasks against devices, but it does not  impose. It is lightweight and fast, but does not ask for much in terms of memory or CPU.

If you like working on network automation using Python, Nornir is definately something to consider.
