Up until this point in my career, most of my scripting efforts involved <b>PyEZ</b>, <b>Paramiko</b> and <b>Netmiko</b>. But after having to work with multiple vendors inside <b>SaltStack</b>, I started looking into <b>NAPALM</b>. This post is a short summary of what I have learned so far about NAPALM in general.

NAPALM in a nutshell
====================

Every networking vendor has its own operating system and all those operating systems have their own APIs. In case you are running a multivendor network, one of the challenges you will run into when you want to start automating, is figuring out how all these different APIs work.

Wouldn’t it be nice if there was some sort of library you could import and have that library deal with all those differences? Like a wrapper around all the vendor-specific things.

Enter <b>NAPALM</b>.

Though it does not abstract everything away, it is quite convenient for a lot of basic operations and it will enable you to get somewhere quickly.


<br>

What devices does NAPALM support?
=================================


At the time of writing, the [docs](https://napalm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) indicate that NAPALM offers support for the following devices:
- Arista EOS
- Cisco IOS
- Cisco IOS-XR
- Cisco NX-OS
- Juniper JunOS

NAPALM uses a set of <b>core drivers</b> to be able to deal with all these vendors. These core drivers are the backend libraries that NAPALM uses to communicate with different operating systems. Currently, the core libraries are the following:

  
  |                     | EOS       | Junos         | IOS-XR     | NX-OS     | NX-OS SSH  | IOS
  | ------------------- | --------- | ------------- | ---------- | --------- | ---------- | ---- 
  | **Driver Name**     | eos       | junos         | iosxr      | nxos      | nxos_ssh   | ios
  | **Backend library** | [pyeapi](https://github.com/arista-eosplus/pyeapi)  | [junos-eznc](https://github.com/Juniper/py-junos-eznc)  | [pyIOSXR](https://github.com/fooelisa/pyiosxr)  | [pynxos](https://github.com/networktocode/pynxos)  | [netmiko](https://github.com/ktbyers/netmiko)  | [netmiko](https://github.com/ktbyers/netmiko)
  

Notice that in NAPALM, Netmiko is used to get NAPALM to talk to NX-OS and IOS over SSH. In the case of IOS, this is as good as it gets due to the fact that Cisco never made an API for that OS.

Another thing worth mentioning is that you can also choose to use these backend libraries directly in your scripts. This can be quite useful to know when you run into situations where NAPALM does not have a certain function available for you. 

Finally, in addition to the core drivers, which are supported and maintained by the people working on NAPALM, there are also various <b>community drivers</b>. Community drivers are maintained under their own repository and can be used by NAPALM. I found a list of community drivers [here](https://github.com/napalm-automation-community).

<br>

Using NAPALM in a Python script 
===============================

![Python logo](/img/python-logo.png "Python logo")

NAPALM offers you a variety of methods that gather information from devices and another set of methods that can help you with your configuration efforts. There a few really nice things about these methods. First of all, you can use them against all the supported vendors. You only have to make sure that you select the proper driver when you use NAPALM to connect to a device. In addition to that, the information that is returned by NAPALM is structured in the same way regardless of the vendor you request the information from. And finally, you are not bothered by the vendor-specifics of these devices.

<br>

## Using NAPALM for information retrieval

Let’s explore the use of several methods NAPALM has to offer and try them out. In the following examples, we will have NAPALM talk to a Juniper and a Cisco device. We will start by using NAPALM to display some information about the device and BGP. After this, we will explore some of the other methods we have available to us and we will finish up sending some CLI commands to a device.

Note before we start. We need to ready the devices so that NAPALM can communicate with them. On IOS XR, this means we need to configure the following:

<pre>
xml agent tty iteration off
</pre>

On Juniper, we need to configure the following:

<pre>
set system services netconf ssh port 830
</pre>

Now, first up is checking device data and retrieving some BGP information. Doing this using NAPALM is very easy. All we need to do the following:
- select the proper driver and create a device object
- open a connection to the device
- use `get_facts` and `get_bgp_neighbors`
- close the connection to the device

The Python required to perform the above when connecting to a Juniper device could be something like the following <b>junos-example.py</b>:

```python
import napalm
from pprint import pprint as pp

driver = napalm.get_network_driver('junos')
device = driver(hostname='169.50.169.100', username='salt', password='salt123')

device.open()
pp(device.get_facts())
pp(device.get_bgp_neighbors())
device.close()
```

When we run the script using <b>python junos-example.py</b>, we get the following:

```python

                                                               u'ipv6': {u'accepted_prefixes': -1,
                                                                         u'received_prefixes': -1,
                                                                         u'sent_prefixes': -1}},
                                           u'description': u'BGP-testing',
                                           u'is_enabled': True,
                                           u'is_up': True,
                                           u'local_as': 1,
                                           u'remote_as': 65500,
                                           u'remote_id': u'169.126.61.167',
                                           u'uptime': 31802}},
             u'router_id': u'10.0.0.6'}}         
```

Without having to write any complex code, we get some information about the device as well as some information about the BGP peers that the device is configured with.

So what happens in the script? After importing the libraries, we specified what driver we wanted to use and instantiated a device object:

```python
driver = napalm.get_network_driver('junos')
device = driver(hostname='169.50.169.100', username='salt', password='salt123')
```

After this, we used several NAPALM methods:

```python
device.open()
pp(device.get_facts())
pp(device.get_bgp_neighbors())
device.close()
```

The `device.open()` and `device.close()` were used to initiate and close a connection to the device. The `device.get_facts()` and `device.get_bgp_neighbors()` were used to retrieve information from the device.

If we were to check the log on the device during the time where we gathered the BGP neighbor information, we can see the following:

<pre>
Sep  9 13:20:50  vmx01 mgd[10297]: UI_NETCONF_CMD: User 'salt' used NETCONF client to run command 'get-instance-information'
Sep  9 13:20:50  vmx01 mgd[10297]: UI_NETCONF_CMD: User 'salt' used NETCONF client to run command 'get-bgp-neighbor-information instance=master'
Sep  9 13:20:50  vmx01 mgd[10297]: UI_NETCONF_CMD: User 'salt' used NETCONF client to run command 'get-bgp-summary-information instance=master'
Sep  9 13:20:51  vmx01 mgd[10297]: UI_NETCONF_CMD: User 'salt' used NETCONF client to run command 'get-bgp-neighbor-information instance=cust-1'
Sep  9 13:20:51  vmx01 mgd[10297]: UI_NETCONF_CMD: User 'salt' used NETCONF client to run command 'get-bgp-summary-information instance=cust-1'
Sep  9 13:20:51  vmx01 mgd[10297]: UI_NETCONF_CMD: User 'salt' used NETCONF client to run command 'get-bgp-neighbor-information instance=mgmt_junos'
Sep  9 13:20:51  vmx01 mgd[10297]: UI_NETCONF_CMD: User 'salt' used NETCONF client to run command 'get-bgp-summary-information instance=mgmt_junos'
</pre>

<br>

NAPALM used the `junos-eznc` backend library to communicate with the Juniper XML API and these were all the RPCs our NAPALM script called. NAPALM completely hides the fact that this happened and the nice thing is that you do not need to know any specifics about the Juniper API. NAPALM issued these RPCs, parsed the return values and created a dictionary for us to work with.

Let's change the example code to something that works for IOS XR and create a new <b>iosxr-example.py</b> script:

```python
import napalm
from pprint import pprint as pp

driver = napalm.get_network_driver('iosxr')
device = driver(hostname='169.50.169.101', username='salt', password='salt123')

device.open()
pp(device.get_facts())
pp(device.get_bgp_neighbors())
device.close()
```

The only thing we needed to do was change the driver from `junos` to `iosxr` and we are good to go! When we run our new <b>iosxr-example.py</b>, we get the following:

```python
{u'fqdn': u'iosxr_1',

                                                                     u'sent_prefixes': 2}},

             u'router_id': u'10.0.1.1'}}
```



In the previous examples, I used <b>get_facts</b> and <b>get_bgp_neighbors</b>. But these are not the only `getters` that NAPALM provides us with. There are many more [NAPALM getters](https://napalm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/support/index.html#getters-support-matrix) for you to check out. A nice way to check them out is by playing around with them in the interpreter:


```python
>>> import napalm
>>> driver = napalm.get_network_driver('iosxr')
>>> device = driver(hostname='169.50.169.101', username='salt', password='salt123')
>>> 
>>> dir(device)

<output omitted>
>>> device.get_bgp_neighbors_detail()
<output omitted>
>>> device.get_config()
<output omitted>
>>> device.get_interfaces_ip()
<output omitted>
>>> device.get_lldp_neighbors()
<output omitted>
```

After having opened the connection to the device using `device.open()`, we used `dir(device)` to list all the methods we have available. We can see that examining the output it is just a matter of issuing the 'getter' methods one by one.

To finish up this section, there is of course also a method that allows you to issue CLI commands. To do this, we use the `cli` method. When we use this method, we pass it a list of CLI commands that we want to send to the device. What the method returns is a dictionary where the key is the CLI command and the value is what the device returned.

A quick example on how to send 2 commands to a Cisco IOS XR device:

```python
import napalm
driver = napalm.get_network_driver('iosxr')
device = driver(hostname='169.50.169.101', username='salt', password='salt123')
device.open()
return_dictionary = device.cli(['show ospf neighbor', 'show ip interface brief', ])
device.close()
print(return_dictionary['show ospf neighbor'])
print(return_dictionary['show ip interface brief'])
```
The data returned by the `cli` method is stored in the `return_dictionary` and at the end of the script, we print the 2 command to screen. Running the script presents us with the following output:

<pre>
.. output omitted ..

Neighbors for OSPF 1

Neighbor ID     Pri   State           Dead Time   Address         Interface

    Neighbor is up for 1w0d

MgmtEth0/RP0/CPU0/0            unassigned      Up              Up       mgmt    
GigabitEthernet0/0/0/0         unassigned      Up              Up       default

.. output omitted ..
</pre>

Instead of printing the keys of the dictionary that `cli` returns, you can also step through it and do with each command and output what you like:

```python
for command,output in return_dictionary.items():
  print(command)
  print(output)
```

## Using NAPALM to configure devices

We can also use NAPALM to configure devices. We can choose to manipulate the configuration using either of the following methods:
- <b>replace</b>: completely removes the existing configuration and puts in a new one
- <b>merge</b>: add configuration statements to the current configuration

Using the previous methods to manipulate the configuration does not change the configuration that is active on the device. It (in Junospeak) alters the candidate configuration but it does not commit. Once we have altered this candidate configuration, we can use the following NAPALM methods:
- <b>compare</b>: see how the configuration would change _if_ you were to apply configuration statements. 
- <b>rollback</b>: change the device configuration to a previous version
- <b>discard</b>: abort any configuration efforts
- <b>commit</b>: apply the configuration changes to the device

As noted in the NAPALM [documentation](https://napalm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/support/index.html#configuration-support-matrix), not all options are available on every device and there are some caveats. However, it comes in very handy on devices that do support these capabilities. I have been able to use these methods on Juniper, Arista and Cisco IOS XR. On these devices, the methods work really well. 

Same as with information gathering, the backend libraries hide all vendor specifics and allow us to use the same code to work with configurations on different vendors. All this without having to write or maintain any Python of our own or without the need to be bothered by their own terminology.

Next is a short example on how we could use NAPALM when configuring a Cisco IOS XR. In the example, we will use the following configuration file:

<pre>
bash-4.4$ cat /var/tmp/iosxr.cfg
interface loopback 0 description description TESTING-1
interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/1.10 description TESTING-2
interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/2.12 description TESTING-3
</pre>

To load this configuration, we can use the following <b>napalm_config.py</b> script:

```python
import napalm
driver = napalm.get_network_driver('iosxr')
device = driver(hostname='169.50.169.101', username='salt', password='salt123')
device.open()
device.load_merge_candidate(filename='/var/tmp/iosxr.cfg')
print(device.compare_config())
device.commit_config()
```

In order to load this configuration file, we can do the following:

<pre>
bash-4.4# python /var/tmp/napalm_config.py

If, after loading the configuration, the `compare_config()` would have shown us something that indicated we should back off, we could have used `device.discard_config()` to discard our configuration efforts. 

Same as when we retrieved information from the device, NAPALM takes care of the device specifics here. We do not need to know that IOS XR has a target configuration and that Juniper has a candidate configuration, etc. We can call the same functions and use them for the different vendors that NAPALM supports.

NAPALM outside of a Python script
=================================


As it says on the [NAPALM website](https://napalm-automation.net/), <b>Napalm plays nice with others!</b>. Efforts have been made to enable the use of NAPALM outside of a Python script. You can use NAPALM for Ansible, Stackstorm and SaltStack. 

In the case of SaltStack, the automation framework I am most familiar with, this was done through the creation of a proxy minion and several modules that exposes most of the methods available in NAPALM. This ensures you will have an easy time gathering data from supported devices, configuring them and all that even comes included with some grains.

Closing thoughts
================

What NAPALM has achieved so far is very impressive. A lot of work has been involved in the creation of the backend libraries and getting NAPALM to play nice with several frameworks. 

They have had quite the impact on the networking community and I can see why this is. It is very convenient to work with and you can get things done quickly. 

There is also some risk involved though. Imagine having to go to another release on a product because of some bug (which is not uncommon). Suppose that on this new version, one of the NAPALMs functions no longer works because of changes in the API on the vendor side breaking the way NAPALM does something. In such cases, at least for a little while, you will be on your own again. 

Another thing worth noting is that not everything is available through NAPALM. For instance, you might be running a protocol for which there are no getters. For these reasons, it is still a good idea to educate someone on the team on the device specific APIs and backend libraries that NAPALM, and you, might come to rely on.
