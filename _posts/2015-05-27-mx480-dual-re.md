Juniper MX: routing engine redundancy.
</p>   
<p>
Juniper MX routers, except for the MX80, are capable of having two routing-engines (RE). 
In this article, I’ll configure an MX480 with some of the high-availability features offered by Junos. 
By using these features, you can decrease the downtime normally associated with a RE failure to an absolute minimum.
</p>
<p>
    Hardware wise, adding a RE is pretty straightforward. The MX480 has the two bottom slots reserved for Switch Control Board’s (SCB’s). The SCB carries the RE and provides control plane functions, chassis management functions and switch plane functions. 
</p>
<p>
    To add a second RE to the MX480 chassis, either slide the RE into the SCB, or insert the SCB together with the RE at the same time:
</p>

![MX480 dual RE](/img/mx480-dual-re-enlarged.jpg "MX480 dual RE")

<p>
    After inserting the second RE, it will boot and come online. 
    The following configuration gives both RE’s their own management IP address and their own hostname (making it easier to see what RE you logged into):
</p>
<pre>
configure
set groups re0 system host-name <font color='red'>MX480-TEST-RE0</font>
set groups re0 interfaces fxp0 unit 0 description mgmt-re0
set groups re0 interfaces fxp0 unit 0 family inet address 10.0.0.255/22
set groups re1 system host-name <font color='red'>MX480-TEST-RE1</font>
set groups re1 interfaces fxp0 unit 0 description mgmt-re1
set groups re1 interfaces fxp0 unit 0 family inet address 10.0.0.232/22
set apply-groups re0
set apply-groups re1
commit synchronize                    
</pre>
<p>
    After committing this configuration, you can delete the original hostname and fxp0 interface:
</p>
<pre>
configure
delete system host-name
delete interface fxp0
commit synchronize                    
</pre>
<p>
    To verify that both RE’s are up, you can issue the '<b>show chassis routing-engine</b>' command.
</p>
<p>
    Perhaps the software running on the redundant RE was not up-to-date? If you’ve bought a new RE, chances are that the software Juniper installed on it differs from the one you are running in your network.  To check this, issue the command ‘<b>show version invoke-on all-routing-engines | match "Hostname|boot"</b>’.
</p>
<p>
    If the software versions differ, upload the proper Junos version to the redundant routing-engine.  
    Make sure that the services configured under [ system services ] as well as the configured firewall filter will allow you to SFTP or FTP to the device.  
    When you are done uploading the proper Junos, you can log in to the redundant RE and initiate the software upgrade by giving the '<b>request system software add jinstall-12.3R8.7-domestic-signed.tgz re1 reboot</b>' command.
</p>

<p>
    The MX should be done with the upgrade under 8 minutes or so. Afterwards, use this command to verify that the software levels are now equal:
</p>
<pre>
play@MX480-TEST-RE1> show version invoke-on all-routing-engines | match "Hostname|boot"
Hostname: MX480-TEST-RE0
JUNOS Base OS boot [12.3R8.7]
Hostname: MX480-TEST-RE1
JUNOS Base OS boot [12.3R8.7]                    
</pre>
<p>
    As soon as both RE’s are running the same Junos release, you're not there yet. If and when you simply add and configure the second RE, you will miss out on certain features that can significantly reduce downtime on a switchover.
</p>
<p>
    To make sure that traffic continues as normal as soon as a routing-engine dies, I’d recommend you to configure two additional features. 
    These are <b>Graceful Routing-Engine Switchover</b> (<b>GRES</b>) and <b>NonStop Routing</b> (<b>NSR</b>).
</p>
<p>
    Enabling GRES will synchronize the RE’s and the RE's will start exchanging keepalives.
    If the backup RE fails to receive a keepalive from the master RE, it assumes the master is compromised. 
    The backup RE will then take mastership. 
    The PFE will be disconnected from the old master RE and it will be connected to the new master RE. 
    During this process, the PFE remains operational.
</p>
<p>
    With GRES enabled, what the backup RE will do is preserve interface and kernel information. 
    What the backup RE will not do with GRES enabled is preserve protocol information. 
    When you enable GRES, the backup RE will not start the RPD. 
    So as soon as there is a switchover, the new master RE will need to restart the RPD.
</p>
<p>
    When the RPD is starting, GRES relies on graceful restart (GR) for a smooth transition between RE’s. GR needs to be active on the node experiencing a switchover as well as on all of the neighboring nodes.
</p>

![dual RE GRES](/img/dual-re-gres.png "dual RE GRES")

<p>
    Without GRES enabled, all neighboring will be very much aware of any switchover and the switchover would be a lot slower as well.
    If GRES is not enabled, the following will take place after a switchover;
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; PFE restarts
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; new master RE discovers the interfaces
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; new master RE restarts the RPD
</p>
<p>
    With GRES enabled, only the restart of the RPD would cause for a delay during a switchover. To solve this, we can enable the NSR feature.
</p>
<p>
    With the development of NSR, Juniper used the work they did on GRES as a foundation. What NSR adds to GRES is that the RPD is started on the backup RE.
</p>

![dual RE NSR](/img/dual-re-nsr.png "dual RE NSR")

<p>
    This way, a failover with NSR will not rely on helper routers running GR. An important note is that the configuration of NSR will exclude the configuration of GR.
</p>
<p>
    To configure bot GRES and NSR, you can apply the following configuration:
</p>
<pre>
configure
set chassis redundancy graceful-switchover
set routing-options nonstop-routing
set system commit synchronize			<font color='red'>! not required, makes life easier</font>
commit synchronize                    
</pre>
<p>
    To verify GRES, we’ll look at the ‘show system switchover’ command. This command can only be issued from the backup RE. To verify NSR, we’ll look at the ‘show task replication’  command. Besides this command, we can also perform the regular show commands for any protocols that the MX is running.

</pre>
<p>
    Note that information for layer2 protocols will not be replicated to the redundant RE by activating NSR. To accomplish this, you will need to enable non-stop bridging (NSB), like this;
</p>
<pre>
set protocols layer2-control nonstop-bridging                    
</pre>
<p>
    Another high-availability feature Junos offers is <b>Unified In-Service Software Upgrade</b> (<b>ISSU</b>). This is a feature that does not require any configuration. What it does need is a dual RE, running the same software version, with both GRES and NSR enabled. Unfortunately, some of the HA features are not (yet) supported for logical systems. These include NSR/NSB and ISSU.
</p>
<p>
    Anyway, after bringing the secondary RE to the same software version as the RE that was already installed, let’s do an ISSU to bring both RE to the JTAC recommended release (which is Junos 13.3R6 on 27-5-2015). I have prepared the following setup:
</p>

<p>
    When the upgrade is done, the old backup RE will be the new master. The upgrade went like this:

    Recap of the configuration commands and the ISSU command;
</p>
<pre>
<b>The redundant RE:</b>

set groups re0 system host-name MX480-TEST-RE0
set groups re0 interfaces fxp0 unit 0 description mgmt-re0
set groups re0 interfaces fxp0 unit 0 family inet address 10.0.0.255/22
set groups re1 system host-name MX480-TEST-RE1
set groups re1 interfaces fxp0 unit 0 description mgmt-re1
set groups re1 interfaces fxp0 unit 0 family inet address 10.0.0.232/22
set apply-groups re0
set apply-groups re1
                
<b>Clean up old hostname:</b>

delete system host-name
delete interface fxp0

<b>Enable GRES, NSR and NSB:</b>

set chassis redundancy graceful-switchover 
set routing-options nonstop-routing 
set protocols layer2-control nonstop-bridging
set system commit synchronize	

<b>Initiate ISSU:</b>

request system software in-service-upgrade jinstall-13.3R6.5-export-signed.tgz reboot                     
</pre>
<p>
    Anyway, with this configuration I enabled GRES and NSR. Then, I upgraded the Juniper MX480 from 12.3 to 13.3. 
    It was running OSPF with a neighboring QFX5100 and the MX was continuously replying to a ping.
    During the upgrade of both RE's, not a single packet was lost and the OSPF adjacency remained up all the while.
    <br>
    Nice!
</p>
